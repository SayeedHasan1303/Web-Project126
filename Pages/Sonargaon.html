<h1>How to go there</h1>

<p style = "font-size:25px"><br>
 Sonargaon, with its rich historical significance, is a must-visit tourist spot in Bangladesh. Let me guide you on how to get there:<br>

<b>By Bus:</b><br>
Frequent bus services operate from various bus stands in Dhaka (such as Gulistan and Saidabad) to Sonargaon.
Tickets can be purchased at roadside counters.
The bus ride from Gulistan typically costs around Tk 43 and takes approximately 40 minutes, depending on traffic.<br>
<b>Private Car or Tour:</b><br>
Opting for a private car or a guided tour is another convenient way to explore Sonargaon.
A private car tour allows flexibility and the opportunity to visit additional attractions.
The journey by car can include a visit to the mini Taj Mahal monument along with Sonargaon.
Private tours usually cost around 5,000 taka.<br>
If you prefer a more budget-friendly option, consider taking a public bus.<br>
Attractions in Sonargaon:<br>
Sonargaon Folk-Arts and Crafts Museum is a popular highlight. It houses artifacts from the 17th century Bengal, including daily life tools, utensils, ornaments, furniture, and more.
The museum is located in an old house called Bara Sardar Bari, built in 1901.
Additionally, a new museum on the same site showcases the enriched fabric culture of Sonargaon, known for its fine-quality fabrics like Moslin.<br>
