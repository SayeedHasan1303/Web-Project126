<b>Start for Tazing:</b><br>
Although Tazing Dong is located in Ruma, you cannot go from Ruma. Because from Ruma now only Keokradong is allowed to go. You can go to Jadipai even if you can go to the maximum. So now if anyone wants to do the Tajingdong Summit, he has to go to Thanchi. And in that case the route will be—

<br>Dhaka - Bandarban - Thanchi - Headmanpara - Sherkarpara - Tajingdong.<br>

Why Thanchi? After the Burma-British War in 1824, Thanchi Upazila was incorporated as a province of Arakan in British India. This facilitated the migration of Arakanese to Thanchi and its neighboring areas. Immigrants settled permanently in the area and Regulation-1 of 1900 (Chittagong Hill Tracts Manual) recognized them as permanent residents.
 The name Thanchi originates from the Marma word Thain Chai or place of rest. It is thought that the place was known as Thain Chai in 1950 or earlier as it was a place where passengers stopped for rest while navigating the waterway, which later came to be known as Thanchi.
The distance from Bandarban Sadar to Thanchi is about 75 kilometers. It is bounded on the northeast by Bilaichhari Upazila of Rangamati, on the north by Ruma Upazila, on the west by Lama Upazila, Alikadam Upazila and on the south by Rakhine State of Myanmar and on the west by China Province of Myanmar.
