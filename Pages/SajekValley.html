Sajek Valley, also known as the “Kingdom of Clouds” and the “Terrace of Rangamati”, is a hidden gem nestled in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh. Let me guide you on how to reach this enchanting destination:

<br><b>Getting to Khagrachari:</b><br>
Start your journey by flying into Dhaka Airport. From there, take a bus to Khagrachari. Several bus services like Shanti Paribahan, Shyamoli Paribahan, Econo, and Er71 operate on this route. The bus fares range from Tk. 700 ($8.15) to Tk. 2000 ($23.28). The journey takes approximately 7-8 hours.
Once you arrive in Khagrachari, you’ll be ready for the next leg of your adventure.<br>
<b>Chander Gari Ride to Sajek Valley:</b><br>
From Khagrachari, you’ll need to travel to Dighinala. You can take a CNG-run auto-rickshaw or any other vehicle to reach Dighinala.
At Dighinala, hop onto a local vehicle called “Chander Gari”. These colorful vehicles provide a breathtaking ride to Sajek Valley. If you’re feeling adventurous, you can even sit on the rooftop!
You have two options:<br>
Shared Ride: Join a shared Chander Gari with fellow travelers.<br>
Private Hire: If you prefer privacy, hire the entire Chander Gari for a more personalized experience.<br>
Alternatively, you can choose a jeep ride (which lacks a roof) if you’re not up for the open-air Chander Gari experience. The jeep fare is around Taka 10,000 ($116.41).
For a private Chander Gari, the cost for a two-day, one-night trip will be approximately Taka 9000 ($104.76).<br>
Enjoy the Scenic Beauty:<br>
As you ascend the hilly road, you’ll be surrounded by dense forests, mountains, and grassland hill tracks.
Sajek Valley’s beauty lies in its mountains above the clouds, nearby waterfalls, and serene grasslands. It truly feels like walking among the clouds.
While modern tourist facilities are limited due to its village location, a few 5-star resorts and restaurants enhance the overall travel experience.
Remember, Sajek Valley is a place where the clouds embrace the earth, and every moment feels like a dream. Enjoy your journey to this magical destination! <br>
